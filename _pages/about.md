This is the landing page of for the Reading Group that runs at Scads.AI and ZIH(CIDS) at TU Dresden. This will contain paper summaries of the papers we read and discuss in the group. Note that the summaries are not meant to be a replacement for reading the paper, but rather a quick way to get an overview of the paper. The summaries are generated with the help of LLMs so there might be some errors in the summaries.
